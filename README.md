# uar-service-documentation

This repository contains all of the accumulated project documentation
related to the UAccess Research upgrade and service re-implementation
started in Summer 2014.

The directory structure mimics some basic ITIL concepts and vocabulary,
but don't assume that just because we borrowed some language and best-practices
that we're doing "strict ITIL" (which doesn't exist anyway).

Although you can use this repository all by itself, it's meant to be
accompanied by the "uar-service-documentation-intent" repository --
see the README file in that project for further details.
